FILES AND FOLDERS INCLUDED IN THIS ZIP
======================================
Driver Installer\       - Contains an installer for Scarlet.Crush's SCP Virtual
                          Bus Driver. You will need this installed for
                          ScpDriverInterface to work.

ScpTester.exe           - An app for testing ScpDriverInterface. Note, I
                          recommend that you don't use Windows's built in Game
                          Controllers dialog, as it is buggy when it isn't in
                          focus. Instead use something like
